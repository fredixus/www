1,0,030734813X,Lesson from this book: Kids are annoying and will get you killed.,4,"Ok I’m slightly exaggerating but have you noticed how frustrating children characters are during a crisis? I’m sure they would be during the apocalypse or when being tracked by dinosaurs but I wanted to throw my phone at the wall a few times while reading this book. With that said, I now have a new completely reasonable phobia, being eaten alive by a dinosaur. Crichton did an amazing job at keeping me on my toes and stressed AF! I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the movie since I remember being traumatized by it as a kid but it totally did! Worth the read!"

3,0,0061929379,Shiver Me Timbers,4,"You know how sometimes you get a gift you had no idea was coming? It's a gift you didn’t know you wanted. The surprise gift turns out to be wonderful, exciting, and it gives you an enormous amount of pleasure, you know? Well that’s what happened to the publishing world and a giant number of readers in 2009.
Michael Crichton had a literary gift far too often nonexistent in a lot of writers. He was, first and foremost, a teller of stories. He could tell stories better than almost anyone. It’s almost like you didn’t read his books, he was in the room telling you the story. He had a limitless imagination. Crichton was the only creative artist to have a #1 TV show, ER (he created it), a #1 movie, Jurassic Park, and a #1 book, Disclosure, all at the same time.
Michael Crichton passed away in 2008. One of his assistants was organizing the papers in Mr. Crichton’s office. When he opened the computer that Crichton used to compose his books he found the surprise gift. There was a completely finished novel that he never talked about and also a partially finished book saved on the computer. The finished book was Pirate Latitudes. It was published in 2009 and sped up the charts. Steven Spielberg secured the film rights and intends to make a movie based on the book.
I have read almost everything Michael Crichton has written but never this one. There it was in the bargain bin for a $1.00. That was my surprise gift. I took it home and didn’t put it down for two days. Even forgot to eat lunch on the second day, LOL. I absolutely loved it.
This is something of an historical novel. The main plot actually happened and the main character, Captain Charles Hunter, is more or less based on the famous pirate Henry Morgan. Captain Hunter is hired by the Governor of Jamaica to plunder a Spanish galleon laden with gold and silver stolen from the inhabitants of South and Central America.
Hunter was a privateer not a pirate. (They convinced themselves there was a difference.) Privateers, like some pirates, were incredibly democratic in how they conducted business. The whole crew shared in the plunder according to his station on the ship so if it was a great haul, everyone got rich. The Captain ruled by election. If the crew wanted another Captain they were given the right to vote on whomever they wanted in the job.
Hunter provisioned his ship in the pirate city of Port Royal, Jamaica. That’s where he got the very colorful crew as well. They were to make way to the Spanish island fortress of Matanceros. It was a Spanish stronghold in the Caribbean, very well defended with huge guns lording over the bay and hundreds of well-trained soldiers. The city was built at the end of the bay with its back to a very large hill. The back of the hill, the other side of the island, was impregnable. It was a sheer vertical cliff.
The galleon was anchored in the bay. The problem was how to get the gold from a place that was unassailable. This is where the story turns into something like thieves robbing a bank in the guise of a pirate story. It’s a caper and you won’t find anything like Captain Jack Sparrow here. This isn’t your kids’ Pirates of the Caribbean. These pirates are violent killers, full of lust, probably sociopaths, cunning and very, very dangerous.
How Captain Hunter solves the problem of separating the gold from the Spanish ship is ingenious. It comes out in the story that his parents brought him to American as part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They were pretty well off so they sent him to a new school in Boston, Harvard. There he was taught critical thinking and problem solving using logic learned from Greek writers. He puts all of this to good use.
They set sail. The adventure begins and it’s splendid. They bump into many obstacles, not the least of which is being captured by a Spanish war ship commanded by Hunter’s nemesis who is also commander of the fort at Matanceros. That’s when everything becomes very personal for both men.
As the Brits say, this is a ripping yarn. I’m sad that Michael Crichton is not with us because Captain Hunter could sure use a sequel. Pirate Latitudes does feel a bit rushed at the end and I think that Mr. Crichton probably would have done another polishing draft but this is a mighty entertaining saga and more than worth the price of admission."
4,0,031624371X,Fantastic Origin Story Stars.,4,"I was a little worried to read this prequel. I totally LoVeD Hadrian and Royce in the Riyria Revelations and it is a completed series. Did I really want to go back to their beginnings to see how it all started??? And the answer is….

YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESSSSSS!!!!!!

MJS is not that author who couldn’t figure out what to write next and so decided hey I’ll write more books in the same world because $$$. Nope not at all, he wrote it because his wife fell in love with another man.

***It’s the classic story of a husband whose wife falls for another man—a more dashing and charming gent. It sounds tragic, but this tale is a bit different because the love affair is between a real woman and a fictional man. My wife—let’s call her Robin (because that’s her name)—has developed an infatuation for Hadrian Blackwater. I’m not sure how I feel about enabling my wife’s relationship with another man, but at least I know this guy is trustworthy ***"
5,0,0385735294,Myth it's not just for breakfast anymore,5,"Micheal Scott has created a fast action story using world myth's and legends and made a fun read. Scott started with the central character Nicholas Flamel -whom, I have explained both to my children and many others, was a real person and not a character from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- and written a great series. The Sorceress is the third book of the series and is as fast paced as the other three each book covering the action of just a couple days.

As a parent I loved the way it pushed my children into doing some academic research to find out about the ""real"" lives of Flamel, John Dee, Machiavelli and more. They also learned about many of the mythical characters. I may have enjoyed the first two books a bit more but I loved the ending of this book and how it sets up the story for the fourth book coming out this May. This is a great read.The Alchemyst: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel

6,0,0312941919,"Bosch, need one say more?",5,"Michael Connelly is a master. This was one of the first Bosch novel I read, back when it had just come out in paperback. I was hooked and had to find the beginning and read them in order. Those old paperback eventually got traded in on his more recent works. I decided to fill the holes in my Connelly library with the Kindle editions and re-read the whole series from the beginning. Every time I read one of the Bosch stories again I pick-up on more details that connect to the plot and to character development. Re-reading this particular book made me realize how loosely the Bosch TV series is based on the books."
7,0,1250012570,I adore this wonderful book.,5,"I am still wiping my eyes. They refuse to stop weeping. I do not know what ages this book was written for, but I am 81, and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I wish I could add an extra star or two. Thank you."
8,1,030734813X,This is one of my favorite books of all time!!! ,5,"I was way excited back then, 20 years ago, about the movie (minus the controversial scene portraiting San José, Costa Rica with a beach in the middle of it). Trust me. I am from Costa Rica and I live precisely in San José and we don't have a dang beach around. I am sure that Spielberg wouldn't do that kind of mistake if he'd need to portrait Paris, France, but a dang capital city in a third world country? Who cares? Well, I care, I am from that precise third world country. When you would have your capital cities portraited in a wrong stereotypical way, you will understand me. (And don't get me wrong. I love the movie and I am fan of Spielberg's work, just pointing out my feeling about that scene that even in the book happens in another different place). I love the book, since the author, Michael Crichton, lived a lot of time in my country, Costa Rica, and he fell in love so much with our culture and geography that he wanted to use it as background for one of his novels. The novel became his most famous book. In the book, you can realize how well Crichton indeed knew about our places using specific real places like the Cabo Blanco Biologic Reserve and the Puntarenas' Hospital Monseñor Sanabria. You don't came out with places like that with your quick internet search. You need to live here to know things like that. Of course, Nublar Island is a made up place but hey, no problem there, it's like Gotham City or Metropolis, always there are space for another fictional island in literature.I was lucky to get my paperback copy of Jurassic Park just when the movie was on its hype 20 years ago, since thanks to that it has the logo of the film (see? I don't hate the movie, just questioned that dang scene).I love my edition of the book since never they published ever again the book with that cover, so it's one my priceless posessions in my library."

10,1,0061929379,Nothing glaringly wrong with it,3,"I’ve been on a pirate kick lately for some reason, and in general I find Crichton’s books fun, inventive, and well-written. But this book was found in his files after his death. It reads well, there is nothing glaringly wrong with it. But, as Entertainment Weekly said back in 2009, If nothing else, Pirate Latitudes is a reminder of the importance of picking an ironclad password for your computer. It reads like a young adult adventure novel, which isn’t a bad thing. I’m sure many 14-year-old adventurers-to-be will enjoy and have loved it. Crichton fans were thrilled when a last novel was found, no doubt, despite a sea of pirate sailing jingo like Mizzen top blown!

But there is a reason Crichton never released it. And it probably starts with re and ends with write."
11,1,031624371X,"The Riyria Revelations saga was a great read, and one of my favorite fantasy series",3,"I am a huge fan of Michael J. Sullivan and his Riyria crew. The Riyria Revelations saga was a great read, and one of my favorite fantasy series.

So, how does that translate back to the prequel? Pretty good, actually. It was great to read about Hadrian and Royce again, and get the details of the origins of their intrepid partnership. All of the same items were present - easy to read story, humor, adventure, and intrigue.

But, that being said, I thought something was missing. Maybe it was that I was already familiar with the basics of the origin story due to references in Revelations. It may also be due to the fact that I read Revelations a number of years ago, and therefore had forgotten some of the side characters, which means I missed many of the easter eggs and references from Chronicles that would make much more sense if the world and characters were more fresh in my mind.

There were a few parts of the story that I thought were a bit implausible, and a bit too convenient, but I can't go into details because I don't want to spoil anything. And finally, it felt to me like Chronicles was a bit more juvenile - more swearing, and a bit darker descriptions and circumstances in the sexuality category as well.

But, like I said, still a great story, and still worth your time."
12,1,0385735294,"If you've not read this, you should",5,"Condition: New.
Shipping: Good.

The is one of the Nicholas Flamel books from the series of the same name (except add ""The Secret of the Immortal"" to the front of ""Nicholas Flamel""). This is an excellent series of books that are fairly easy reads.

The series character was actually a fairly popular historical figure who, according to wikipedia, ""was a successful French scrivener and manuscript-seller who developed a posthumous reputation as an alchemist due to his reputed work on the philosopher's stone."" His cult status was emphasized in the Harry Potter series, who's first book was titled after the famous stone.

NOTE: This book series is not related to the Harry Potter ""universe"" or series."
13,1,0312941919,Another good read in a great series,4,"Trunk Music is the 5th Bosch novel and Connelly’s 6th novel to write (I believe). As is the case, this review is probably somewhat pointless. If you like Bosch, you’ll read this whether I tell you to or not. If you haven’t read Connelly before, this isn’t really the best place to start – there are characters here that have been introduced in previous novels and frankly, there are a handful of misses here. It is a good read though. Fast-paced, some unexpected twists, even lady entropy makes some sudden and explosive appearances. Like many of these series mystery novels, a portion of the tale is used to continue the overarching story of the main characters. Here, we get a new romance for Bosch that almost certainly will have some appearances in later novels. These moments didn’t necessarily drag for me, but they weren’t my favorite. Connelly handles police procedure better than he does sweet nothings. For some reason, the chapters in this one are really long. For example, chapter three beings on page 207. It’s hard to pinpoint the exact effect that had on my experience, but instincts tell me it wasn’t positive. I don’t know if he does that again in a later novel, but of the ones I’ve read, which is about ten, this is the first I’ve seen him do this.

All in all, another enjoyable night on the town with Bosch."
14,1,1250012570,"Can a 70 year old be considered a ""Young Adult""?",5,"I doubt that I fall into the 'target market' for this book. I'm not even sure what a young adult is. Should I recommend this book for my 14 year old grandson? But then I don't think any of these labels or definitions matter at all when the book under question is a really well-written book as is ""Eleanor and Park"" (EP). I was attracted to it because I had read many complimentary reviews and found it on a number of lists of 2013 best books. And I was in the mood for something different. And EP is very different from my normal crime fiction/spy novel selections, a nice break. Park is sitting on the school bus one morning as usual, when he looks up during one of the stops and spots an obviously new student , lost and frozen in place, looking for a ""safe"" seat to claim. Her style is all her own right up to the mass of tangled bright red locks crowning her dome (see the cover). Park, anxious to break the tension created by a yelling bus driver (""sit down!""), makes room for her, utters the standard expletive, and gets results.....she sits. It's not a Bogart-Bergman moment. But slowly and tenderly a relationship develops, and it becomes evident that this author knows how to pace her story. But Ms. Rowell's skills go far beyond. She may not know her audience, but she knows her characters, and not just her main ones, but high schooler's parents, siblings and teachers as well. The dialog rings true and spot on. Here are two people who first appear as suited for each other as oil and water, but gradually mesh together in perfect sync. They have their ups and downs, and they face problems from parents and other students, but they are honest and have few pretentions - and they are in love. And their romance works and the story does as well, all the way till the very end. So I recommend this highly - for ""young adults"" of all ages."
15,2,030734813X,"Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.",5,"Jurassic Park has all the major problems of a theme park, a zoo...and genetically altered prehistoric animals. That's right - the dinosaurs are back from the dead and nothing - I repeat nothing - could go wrong...right? Ha. As my favorite character, Ian Malcom would say, All major changes are like death. You can't see to the other side until you are there."
